# Hourly
An android app that nominally runs other apps hourly.

This app was heavily derived from AppAlarm at https://github.com/ghackett/AppAlarm.  The README file at that site states that "AppAlarm is now free on the Android Market and anyone is free to do whatever they want with the code. It is officially licensed under the Apache 2 license - http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html".  I have done whatever I want with this code, but preserved this reference to the license of the original author just in case that matters at all.
